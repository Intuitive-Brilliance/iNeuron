    "#### Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "<br>- **`try`** statement is used for exception handling in python. \n",
    "<br>- Exception handling consists of a block of risky statements which might cause an exception during runtime. \n",
    "<br>- If code within try block raises exception, then the exception will be reverted to the corresponding except block if multiple except blocks are present, else it willbe reverted to the default except block. \n",
    "<br>- In this way the try and except in union avoid programs from crashing during runtime due to exceptions."

    "3. **`try`,`except`,`finally`,`else`**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>- The **`try`** block is used to check code for exceptions during runtime. \n",
    "<br>- The code inside `try` block will execute completely when there is no error in the program. \n",
    "<br>- Te code inside `except` block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the preceeding **`try`** block.\n",
    "<br>- the code enters the **`else`** block if and only if the try clause does not raise and exception. \n",
    "<br>- The code in the **`finally`** block will execute irrespective of exception."

    "<br>- **`raise`** statement helps in triggering exception as per programming logic."

    "**Ans:** \n",

    "<br>- This type of requirement is fulfilled by **`assert`** statement. \n",
    "<br>- This statement takes a boolean condition output of which is True, Further Program Executes. \n",
