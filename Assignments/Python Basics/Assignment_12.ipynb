    "<br>A Document object contains a list of **`Paragraph`** objects for the paragraphs in the document. \n",
    "<br>A new paragraph begins whenever the user presses `ENTER` or `RETURN` while typing in a Word document.\n",
    "<br>Each of these Paragraph objects contains a list of one or more **`Run`** objects.\n",
    "<br>A Run object is a contiguous run of text with the same style. \n",
    "<br>A new Run object is needed whenever the text style changes.\n",
    "<br>This is because a text in a Word document is more than just a string. It has font, size, color, and other styling information associated with it. A style in Word is a collection of these attributes. "

      "A wing with feature-flap is disclosed to enhance the aerodynamic efficiency. The feature includes aerodynamic and non-aerodynamic shape attached to single or multiple locations on and below the wing flap as an integrated part of 5 it. When the wing with feature-flap is subjected to the aerodynamic force, it tends to increase the lift force and decrease the drag force as compare to the wing with simple-flap. This way, the aerodynamic efficiency of the wing can be increased beyond the critical point of airfoil, wing shape and flap shape optimization\n",

      "2.1. AIRFOIL\n",
      "\n",
      "An airfoil is a surface designed to obtain a desirable reaction from the air through which it moves. Thus, we can say that any part of the aircraft which converts air resistance into a force useful for flight is an airfoil. The blades of a propeller are so designed that when they rotate, their shape and position cause a higher pressure to be built up behind them than in front of them so that they will pull the aircraft forward. The model of a wing gives an excellent example of streamlines around airfoil. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although the top surface of the conventional wing profile has greater curvature than the lower surface, the principal thing is the larger density of streamlines above the win. The larger density of streamlines means the greater velocity of air. The role of the wing is to generate lift and lift is perpendicular to the incoming flow.\n",
      "Lift creation can be described in two ways:\n",
      "Pressure differential: The air pressure on the bottom surface of the wing is higher than the air on the top surface. This pressure difference creates a net force upwards.\n",
      "Newton’s third law: The wing pushed air downwards. As a consequence, the air itself pushes the wing \n",
      "                   upwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either way, the law of conservation applies: mass, momentum, and energy.\n",
      "Lift, or downforce as it's known in the motor racing world, is the force generated perpendicular to the direction of travel for an object moving through a fluid (gas or liquid). The same effect occurs when a fluid moves over stationary object, such as an airfoil in a wind tunnel. Airfoils are the most efficient shapes found so far that can generate lift while at the same time minimizing drag. Whereas drag is an unavoidable consequence of an object moving through a fluid. Drag is the force generated parallel and in opposition to the direction of travel for an object moving through a fluid.\n",
      "Efficiency of a wing is measured in terms of the lift over drag (LID) ratio. This ratio varies with the angle of attack but reaches a definite maximum value for a particular angle of attack. At this angle, the wing has reached its maximum efficiency. The shape of the airfoil is the factor which determines the angle of attack at which the wing is most efficient; it also determines the degree of efficiency.\n",

      "2.3 WING FLAPS\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Flaps are high lift devices, intended to produce maximum lift coefficients on aerodynamically designed wings of aircraft. The flap is placed on the outside edge of an airplane's wing. The use of these aerodynamic extensions is done in order to increase the effective area of wing thereby generating extra lift force required for an aircraft wing. The aircraft wing experiences a turbulent boundary layer flow over its surface, caused due to velocity or pressure fluctuations and responsible for generation of lift.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deployment of flap configurations to main aerofoil is done for the take-off stage partially since velocity of aircraft is low. The high lift and low drag action produced as result also helps to increase the pay load capacity or take-off weight of an aircraft. For smooth landing conditions the aircraft must again slow before the touch down on runway for which the trailing edge flap devices are deployed to produce high lift and high drag on wing surface.\n",
      "Flaps help to either increase or decrease the camber, or surface area, of the airplane wing. Camber includes how \n",
      "\n",
      "convex the upper part of the wing is, as well as the concavity of the lower half. Wing flaps are a significant part of the takeoff and landing process. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the airplane is taking off, the flaps help to produce more lift. Conversely, flaps allow for a steep but controllable angle during landing. During both, efficient use of flaps helps to shorten the amount of runway length needed for takeoff and landing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wing flaps change the shape of the airplane wing. They divert the air around the wing as necessary. The setting of the flap determines whether they are used to increase lift (as on takeoff) or increase drag (used on landing.) When the airplane's flaps are up, the camber of the airplane is such that the wings can produce more lift. Depending on the aircraft, the flap settings are usually between five and fifteen degrees. After liftoff, the wing flaps are retracted completely so that they do not begin to produce drag.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wing is a type of fin, having a streamline cross-section, which when subjected to aerodynamic force, acts like an airfoil. The shape which maintains the airfoil cross-section over its length is generally known as wing shape. The airfoil and wing shape in conjunction form a wing. A flap is a high-lift device usually mounted on the wing trailing edges. Various types of airfoil, wing and flap are 10 present as per the requirement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mostly, the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing is improved either by enhancing airfoil, wing shape, flap shape or all. While optimizing, we reach a certain point where further alteration in airfoil, wing shape and flap shape reduces the performance of the wing. Thus, there is challenge to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of wing when we reach such critical point of optimization\n",
      "\n",
      "A wing with feature-flap for enhancing the aerodynamic efficiency is described. More particularly, the present disclosure describes a wing flap, in which, aerodynamic and non-aerodynamic shape known as feature is attached at different 10 locations. Conventional wing flap does not come with such feature as an integrated part. As discussed above, though they are able to generate the lift, however, they fail to increase the wing aerodynamic \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finite element analysis has now become an integral part of computer aided engineering (CAE) and is being extensively used in the analysis and design of many complex real-life systems. While it started off as an extension of matrix methods of structural analysis and was initially perceived as a tool for structural analysis alone, its applications now range from structure to bio-mechanics to electromagnetic field problems. Simple linear static problems as well as highly complex nonlinear transient dynamic problems are effectively solved using the finite element method. The field of finite element analysis has matured and now rests on rigorous mathematical foundation. Many powerful commercial software packages are now available, enabling its widespread use in several industries.\n",
      "Classical analytical methods consider a differential element and develop the governing equations, usually in the form of partial differential equations. When applied to real-life problem situations, it is often difficult to obtain an exact solution to these equations in view of complex geometry and boundary conditions. The finite element method (FEM) can be viewed simply as a method of finding approximate solutions for partial differential equations or as tool to transform partial differential equations into algebraic equations, which are then easily solved.\n",
      "Finite: Any continuous object has infinite degrees of freedom and it is possible to solve problem in this format. The finite element method reduces the degrees of freedom from infinite to finite with help of discretization or meshing.\n",
      "Element: All of the calculations are made at a limited number of points known as nodes. The entity joining nodes and forming a specific shape such as quadrilateral or triangular is known as an element.\n",
      "Method: There are 3 methods to solve any engineering problem. Finite analysis belongs to numerical method category.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "WHY SHOULD ONE USE FINITE ELEMENTS?\n",
      "The versatility of the fem, along with its rich mathematical formulation and robustness makes it an ideal numerical method for a wide range of problems. The ability to modal complex geometries using unstructured \n",
      "\n",
      "meshes and employing elements that can be individually tagged makes the method unique. The ease of implementing boundary conditions as well as being able to use a wide family of element types is a definite advantage of the scheme over other methods. In addition, the FEM can be shown to stem from properly posed functional minimization principles.\n",
      "Types of Finite Elements\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many different types of elements used in FEA. These elements are developed independently and vary from one finite element (FE) software to another. In general, there are three groups of element which are one- dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) elements. They are recognized based on their shapes.\n",
      "Elements can take on the form of a straight line or curve, triangle or quadrilateral, tetrahedral and many more. The simplest element is a line made of two nodes. All line elements, whether straight or curved, are called 1D element in which they have translational and rotational displacement functions. Examples of 1D element are truss element and beam element. Example: Truss, beam, spring, pipe etc.\n",
      "2D elements are typically surface elements with triangle or quadrilateral as their basic shapes. Examples of 2D elements are 3-node triangular element, 6-node triangular element, and many more. These surface elements can have regular or irregular shapes shown in fig: 3.1 2D elements are plane elements. Therefore, linear approximation of translational displacements considered are u(x, y) and v(x, y) while rotational displacements are θ(x, y). Since they account for plane stress and plain strain, they are often used to solve 2D elasticity problems.\n",
      "3D elements are usually used to mesh volumes. They are derived from 2D elements are used when the problem is unable to be simplified. 3D solid elements only accounts for translational displacements. The three translational unknown displacement functions are u(x, y, z), v(x, y, z), and w(x, y, z). Examples of 3D solid elements are 4- node tetrahedral element, 10-node tetrahedral element, 8-node iso parametric element, etc.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSYS is the original (and commonly used) name for ANSYS Mechanical or ANSYS Multiphysics, general- purpose finite element analysis software. ANSYS, Inc actually develops a complete range of CAE products, but is perhaps best known for ANSYS Mechanical & ANSYS Multiphysics. The academic versions of these commercial products are referred to as ANSYS Academic Research, ANSYS Academic Teaching Advanced, Introductory etc. All of these products are general purpose finite element self contained analysis tools incorporating pre-processing (geometry creation, meshing), solver and post processing modules in a unified graphical user interface (GUI). \n",
      "\n",
      "For the remainder of this appendix, when we state ‘‘ANSYS’’, we mean the FEA capability of either the commercial or academic ANSYS Inc. products discussed above. Further we are limiting our discussion to the traditional (or ‘‘classic’’) user interface of ANSYS, not the ANSYS Workbench environment. One of the advantages of ‘‘ANSYS’’ is the user-programmable capability. The ANSYS Command Language contains several thousand commands relating to creating geometry, mesh, boundary conditions, solver settings & many other features. A subset of these commands are termed ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL), and focus on managing parameters, macros, if-then-else branching, do-loops, and scalar, vector and matrix operations. For example, if multiple analyses are required with different values of parameters, do-loops can be used to change parameters or the Optimization module (/OPT) can be used to automatically manage parameters & populate a response surface. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are two different modes of performing finite element analysis in ANSYS: batch and interactive modes. The batch mode requires an input file of commands and executes it from the command line, while the interactive mode turns on the graphical user interface and shows the result of each user action (picked from a menu or typed as a command) in a graphics window. The batch mode is best suited for those experienced with the ANSYS Command Language. In this tutorial, only the interactive mode will be explained. There are two different modes of inputting commands in ANSYS: graphic mode and text mode. In the graphic mode, the user can pick commands and type in required data values. Thus, there is no need to memorize all commands. This mode is beneficial in a sense that the user can see the result of each command in the graphic window. In the text mode, the user type in commands and data in the command area. In this case, the user should remember what command should be used to perform a particular action. However, the text mode has its own advantages\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSYS is a general-purpose finite-element modelling package for numerically solving a wide variety of mechanical problems. These problems include static/dynamic, structural analysis (both linear and nonlinear), heat transfer, and fluid problems, as well as acoustic and electromagnetic problems. ANSYS provides a comprehensive set of computational fluid dynamics software to model fluid flow and other related physical phenomena. It offers unmatched fluid flow analysis capabilities, providing all the tools needed to design and optimize new fluid equipment and to solve existing installation problems. The main ANSYS products in the liquid area are ANSYS Fluent and ANSYS CFX. With this solution, you can simulate various phenomena: aerodynamics, combustion, hydrodynamics, liquid / solid / gas mixture, particle dispersion, reaction flow, heat transfer, and more. Steady-State and Transient Flow phenomena are easily and quickly resolved. Graphical results from ANSYS CFX or ANSYS FLUENT CFD software simulations will show how fluid flow, particle flow, heat transfer, chemical reactions, combustion, and other parameters develop over time. In general, a finite-element solution may be broken into the following three stages.\n",

      "Analysis was conducted on a wing containing a feature-flap and on a wing without. It was found that the wing with the feature flap exhibited higher aerodynamic efficiency compared to the one without. This could offer several advantages including shorter take-offs and landings, reduced drag compared to lift, and reduced fuel consumption. In addition, a variation of the feature flap, porotype PDC1554 was tested against several test cases, with velocity varying from The results of the analysis indicate that the prototype PDC 1554 has the highest aerodynamic efficiency at AOA = 1, Alpha = 17, Beta = 14 and the lowest efficiency was observed at AOA = 1, Alpha = 17, Beta = 19. This indicates that with the increase in the outer flap deflection, the effectiveness of the feature enhancement drops significantly.  10 m/s to 100m/s with  angle of  attack and alpha constant,  and beta varying between  14 and 19 degrees. Although the wing analysis was done in isolation without considering the effects of the flap enchantment on the other components of the aircrafts, the advantages it offers highlight its possibility of incorporation into the aircraft.\n",
